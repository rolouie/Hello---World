# Hello---World
This Is my first created source file for storing ideas, problems  and discussions
My name is Robert Louie and the purpose of joining GitHub is to update my skills, engage and Network with the HUB community.  I want to contribute to project that I am passionate about. 

These changes were made to learn how a branch works.

Alright listen, this is getting very anoring to me. I want to explore the changes in the file according to the direction on the "Hello World" activities site for GitHub. It appears that no comparsion show up at all, how come? 

Lately, I have not been doing much with version control, GitHub. Currently, I thought that I would revisit this page to see if any of the work that I had done had changed dusk far. Seeing that the Hello World repository still exists, I thought that I would refresh my memory of working within GitHub. Therefore, I am updating this file.
